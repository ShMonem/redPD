This repository hosts projective dynamics implementations that are used to serve comparisions for different reduction subspaces for the physics based simulations.

- We used the code published for [Hyper-reduced projective dynamics](https://replicability.graphics/papers/10.1145-3197517.3201387/index.html), under MIT license, as a base code.
- In the old original code by C. Brandt, linear-blend reduction subspaces can be computed.
- Current code can read any provided position reduction bases and apply them to simulations.
